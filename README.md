PROJECT SUMMARY

In this project, we will be practicing inserting and querying data using SQL. We'll utilize a handy online tool provided by DevMountain that allows us to write SQL directly in our browser. Click Me

On the left are the Tables with their fields; the right side is where we will write our queries, and the bottom is where we will view our results.

Any new tables or records that we add to the database will be removed after you refresh the page.
